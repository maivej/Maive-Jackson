## Maive Jackson Designs



## About Me
I am a graphic designer with my bachelor of Fine Arts in Graphic Design. I have 5+ years of professional experience designing both for individuals, small businesses and large companies. I am, unofficially, the "ideas girl", a wellspring of fresh new ideas on how to make the world (including my client's businesses) connect more efficiently. 

Originally from the small island country of Dominica, I moved to the Virgin islands at 11 and to the mainland United States when I was 19. I was blessed to grow and learn as a creative in multiple environments and look at things from multiple perspectives. Today, I translate that blessing to dynamic, creative solutions for my clients as we work together to bring their vision to life.

I love learning about new cultures and engaging with new people and that translates to my work. I bring my colorful personality into everything that I do, whether it's designing, cooking, conversing with friends or any one of my other loves and I look forward to bringing it to future projects.
